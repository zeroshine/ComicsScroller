For example:\n\t *\n\t *                                            <Paper>\n\t *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n\t *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n\t *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n\t *                                            </Paper>\n\t *\n\t *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element \n\t *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a \n\t *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using \n\t *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n\t *\n\t *  <p>\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n\t *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper> \n\t *  </p>\n\t *\n\t *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can \n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement \n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\t\n\t  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n\t    return {\n\t      beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t      afterElementType: 'div',\n\t      elementType: 'div' };\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  render: function render() {\n\t    var _props = this.props;\n\t    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n\t    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n\t    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n\t    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n\t    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\t\n\t    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\t\n\t    var beforeElement, afterElement;\n\t\n\t    beforeStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\t    afterStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\t\n\t    if (this.props.beforeStyle) beforeElement = React.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, { style: this.mergeAndPrefix(beforeStyle, this.props.beforeStyle),\n\t      key: '::before' });\n\t    if (this.props.afterStyle) afterElement = React.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, { style: this.mergeAndPrefix(afterStyle, this.props.afterStyle),\n\t      key: '::after' });\n\t\n\t    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\t\n\t    var props = other;\n\t    props.style = this.props.style;\n\t\n\t    return React.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t});\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 293 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1;
